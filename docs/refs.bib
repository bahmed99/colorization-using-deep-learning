  abstract = {Colorization is a computer-assisted process of adding color to a monochrome image or movie. The process typically involves segmenting images into regions and tracking these regions across image sequences. Neither of these tasks can be performed reliably in practice; consequently, colorization requires considerable user intervention and remains a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive task.In this paper we present a simple colorization method that requires neither precise image segmentation, nor accurate region tracking. Our method is based on a simple premise; neighboring pixels in space-time that have similar intensities should have similar colors. We formalize this premise using a quadratic cost function and obtain an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using standard techniques. In our approach an artist only needs to annotate the image with a few color scribbles, and the indicated colors are automatically propagated in both space and time to produce a fully colorized image or sequence. We demonstrate that high quality colorizations of stills and movie clips may be obtained from a relatively modest amount of user input.},

Although the general problem of adding chromatic values to a greyscale image has no exact, objective solution, the current approach attempts to provide a method to help minimize the amount of human labor required for this task. Rather than choosing RGB colors from a palette to color individual components, we transfer the entire color "mood" of the source to the target image by matching luminance and texture information between the images. We choose to transfer only chromatic information and retain the original luminance values of the target image. Further, the procedure is enhanced by allowing the user to match areas of the two images with rectangular swatches. We show that this simple technique can be successfully applied to a variety of images and video, provided that texture and luminance are sufficiently distinct. The images generated demonstrate the potential and utility of our technique in a diverse set of application domains.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an example-based colorization technique robust to illumination differences between grayscale target and color reference images. To achieve this goal, our method performs color transfer in an illumination-independent domain that is relatively free of shadows and highlights. It first recovers an illumination-independent intrinsic reflectance image of the target scene from multiple color references obtained by web search. The reference images from the web search may be taken from different vantage points, under different illumination conditions, and with different cameras. Grayscale versions of these reference images are then used in decomposing the grayscale target image into its intrinsic reflectance and illumination components. We transfer color from the color reflectance image to the grayscale reflectance image, and obtain the final result by relighting with the illumination component of the target image. We demonstrate via several examples that our method generates results with excellent color consistency.},

Rather than relying on a series of independent pixel-level decisions, we develop a new strategy that attempts to account for the higher-level context of each pixel. The colorizations generated by our approach exhibit a much higher degree of spatial consistency, compared to previous automatic color transfer methods [WAM02]. We also demonstrate that our method requires considerably less manual effort than previous user-assisted colorization methods [LLW04].Given a grayscale image to colorize, we first determine for each pixel which example segment it should learn its color from. This is done automatically using a robust supervised classification scheme that analyzes the low-level feature space defined by small neighborhoods of pixels in the example image. Next, each pixel is assigned a color from the appropriate region using a neighborhood matching metric, combined with spatial filtering for improved spatial coherence. Each color assignment is associated with a confidence value, and pixels with a sufficiently high confidence level are provided as "micro-scribbles" to the optimization-based colorization algorithm of Levin et al. [LLW04], which produces the final complete colorization of the image.},

  abstract = {We present a new example-based method to colorize a gray image. As input, the user needs only to supply a reference color image which is semantically similar to the target image. We extract features from these images at the resolution of superpixels, and exploit these features to guide the colorization process. Our use of a superpixel representation speeds up the colorization process. More importantly, it also empowers the colorizations to exhibit a much higher extent of spatial consistency in the colorization as compared to that using independent pixels. We adopt a fast cascade feature matching scheme to automatically find correspondences between superpixels of the reference and target images. Each correspondence is assigned a confidence based on the feature matching costs computed at different steps in the cascade, and high confidence correspondences are used to assign an initial set of chromatic values to the target superpixels. To further enforce the spatial coherence of these initial color assignments, we develop an image space voting framework which draws evidence from neighboring superpixels to identify and to correct invalid color assignments. Experimental results and user study on a broad range of images demonstrate that our method with a fixed set of parameters yields better colorization results as compared to existing methods.},

Based on Convolutional Neural Networks, our deep network features a fusion layer that allows us to elegantly merge local information dependent on small image patches with global priors computed using the entire image. The entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the colorization model, is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification database to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a hundred years ago, and show realistic colorizations.},
